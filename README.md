AMA.js
======

A Javascript library that helps connect to the Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses' (AMA) API.

AMA.js provides a Javascript wrapper for the API of the Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses (AMA). If you are writing a Node.js app, or you are developing a server side solution in Javascript, then this is the perfect solution for you. Don't waste time writing code and handling APIs errors. We did this for you already. Log in, and call the libraries methods. You'll receive the data returned by the API server. Now it's up to you to make use of the data.

Happy hacking!
